# SQL-Data-Cleaning-Project
This repository contains a SQL-based data cleaning project designed to preprocess, transform, and refine raw datasets for improved accuracy, consistency, and usability. The project focuses on identifying and handling missing values, removing duplicates, standardizing data formats, correcting inconsistencies, and optimizing database structures to ensure high-quality data.

Key Features:
Duplicate Removal – Identifies and eliminates redundant records to maintain data integrity.
Data Standardization – Ensures uniform formatting for dates, strings, and numeric values.
Handling Missing Values – Implements strategies such as imputation or deletion to manage incomplete data.
Data Validation – Checks for inconsistencies, incorrect data types, and logical errors.
Optimization – Enhances query performance by restructuring tables, indexing, and normalizing data where necessary.
This project is useful for data analysts, database administrators, and developers looking to clean and structure raw data effectively using SQL queries.
